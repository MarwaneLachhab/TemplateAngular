With your SQL expertise, you can not only enrich the left menu by incorporating links, modifying the logo, adding cards, and including both parent and child links but also expand its capabilities by seamlessly adding footer links, slider images, and navbar links. This versatility empowers you to comprehensively customize and elevate the entire interface.
